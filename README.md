My thesis

Dear person / organisation interested in my thesis,

I created this repository to present my research topic and to help you follow along my progress.

You will see it is structured in Results and Code. Both are created to be easy to read and understand. Any feedback is welcome at serban-petre@mail.com

Special thanks to University of GÃ¶ttingen and Agvolution GmbH for supporting my topic.
